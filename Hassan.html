                    Hassan District is one of the 30 districts of Karnataka state located in the south-western part of Karnataka in India. 
                    The district has had an eventful and rich history. In the past, it reached the height of its glory during the rule of the Hoysalas who had their 
                    capital at Dwarasamudra, the modern Halebeed in Belur Taluk. The district, noted for its enchanting natural scenic beauty is also a veritable treasure-house 
                    of Hoysala architecture and sculpture, the best specimens of which are at Belur and Halebeed. Shravanabelagola, in Channarayapatna taluk, 
                    which is studded with Jain moduments, is a renowned centre of pilgrimage for the jains.<br>
                    
                    Like most of the other districts in the State, this district also derives its name from its headquarters town, Hassan. According to the Sthalapurana, 
                    the name ‘Hassan’ is a contraction or derivative of ‘Simhasanapura’, associated with janamejaya, a great grandson of the Pandava hero, Arjuna. 
                    But the popular belief is that the place is called Hassan after the goddess Hassan-amma or Hasanamba, the presiding deity of the local Hasanamba temple situated 
                    in the old town area. Hasanamma or Hasanamba means, in Kannada, a smiling mother or goddess. In this connection, a traditional story, as to how the goddess 
                    Hasanamba came to be established at this place, is narrated thus : The Saptamatrikas (seven mothers or goddesses), in the course of their journey from Varasasi 
                    (Kashi) to the South, were pleased with the scenic splendour of this area and decided to make it their abode. Accordingly, of the seven mothers, who were sisters, 
                    three settled at Hassan and another three in a tank called Devigere, also in Hassan proper, and were called Hasanamba, while the other one settled in a forest 
                    near Kenchammana-Hosakote in Alur taluk and was called Kenchamba.<br>
                    
                    Hassan district lies partly in the “malnad” tract and partly in the southern “maidan”(plains) tract. By considering the physical aspects, climate, rainfall, etc. 
                    the district may be divided into three regions, viz., (1) southern malnad, (2) semi-malnad and (3) southern maidan. western and north-eastern portions of the 
                    Belur taluk, western and central parts of Alur taluk and the whole of Sakaleshapura taluk constitute the “southern malnad” region, the central parts of the 
                    Arkalgud taluk, the western portion of the Hassan taluk, the eastern portion of the Alur taluk, the central and eastern parts of the Belur taluk and the 
                    western parts of the Arasikere taluk form the “semi-malnad” region. The southern maidan region includes the whole of the Holenarasipura and Channarayapatna taluks, 
                    eastern parts of the Arasikere and Hassan taluks and the south-eastern portions of the Arkalgud taluk. The southern malnad is a forest-clad hilly region with a 
                    heavy rainfall.<br>

                                    1792 with the aim to ward off enemy infiltrations from Mangaluru and Madikeri side. The unique aspect of this fort is that it is built in a star shaped design. 
                                    It has a form with 8 angular tips stretching in 8 directions with a plus shaped well at the centre.</p>

                                    The area around the church got deserted 
                                    after the construction of the Gorur Dam; as during the monsoon the region got flooded and the church used to get submerged. The fact that this church remains 
                                    submerged in water during monsoons makes it special as well as surreal at the same time. If you happen to visit the place during peak monsoon season, 
                                    only one-third of the chapel could be visible.</p>

        <h3>About Tourism</h3> <br>
        <div>
            <span>Tourism is vital for the success of many economies around the world. There are several benefits of
                tourism on host destinations.
                Tourism boosts the revenue of the economy, creates thousands of jobs, develops the infrastructures of a
                country, and plants a sense of cultural exchange between foreigners and citizens.
                The number of jobs created by tourism in many different areas is significant. These jobs are not only a
                part of the tourism sector but may also include the agricultural sector,
                communication sector, health sector, and the educational sector. Many tourists travel to experience the
                hosting destination’s culture, different traditions, and gastronomy.
                This is very profitable to local restaurants, shopping centers, and stores. Melbourne, Australia’s
                population is greatly affected by tourism.
                It has a population of around 4 million people and around 22,000 citizens are employed by the tourism
                sector only.</span> <br>

            <br>

            <span>Governments that rely on tourism for a big percentage of their revenue invest a lot in the
                infrastructure of the country.
                They want more and more tourists to visit their country which means that safe and advanced facilities
                are necessary.
                This leads to new roads and highways, developed parks, improved public spaces, new airports, and
                possibly better schools and hospitals.
                Safe and innovative infrastructures allow for a smooth flow of goods and services. Moreover, local
                people experience an opportunity for economic and educational growth.</span> <br>

                <span>Tourism creates a cultural exchange between tourists and local citizens. Exhibitions, conferences, and
                    events usually attract foreigners.
                    Organizing authorities usually gain profits from registration fees, gift sales, exhibition spaces, and
                    sales of media copyright. Furthermore,
                    foreign tourists bring diversity and cultural enrichment to the hosting country.
                    Tourism is a great opportunity for foreigners to learn about a new culture, but it also creates many
                    opportunities for local citizens.
                    It allows young entrepreneurs to establish new products and services that would not be sustainable on
                    the local population of residents alone.
                    Moreover, residents experience the benefits that come with tourism occurring in their own
                    country.</span> <br>
